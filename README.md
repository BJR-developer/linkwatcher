# Link Watcher - Stop Doing Pause App Project

## The purpose of this application is to provide a way to track whether or not a specific website, folder, application, etc. is visited or accessed.

### How it works:

* You specify a specific location (website, folder, app, etc.) that you want to monitor.
* If you access this location, the app notes it and displays it on the main list of tracked items.
* You can also specify an optional time period, allowing the tracker to identify whether or not a location has been accessed in the past day, week, month, etc.

### Stop Doing Pause App Project

* Stop Doing Pause App Project is the target of this application. The app will help you with a lot of your project. Some of its benefits are:
    * The app automatically tracks the websites you visit, the folders you open, and the apps you use.
    * It lets you monitor your progress by seeing how often you've stopped using a particular app or website.
    * You can choose to create and set your own goals. For example, if you'd like to spend more time working, you can set a goal of using Twitter no more than 30 minutes per day. The app will then track your use of Twitter and keep you updated on your progress.
